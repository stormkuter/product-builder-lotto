# Lotto Number Generator

## Overview

This project is a simple web application that generates random lottery numbers. It's built using modern HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, leveraging Web Components for a modular and reusable UI.

## Design and Features

*   **Modern UI:** The application features a clean and visually appealing design with a bold color scheme, subtle animations, and a responsive layout.
*   **Web Component-based:** The core functionality is encapsulated in a `<lotto-generator>` custom element, making it easy to reuse and maintain.
*   **Number Generation:** It generates 6 unique random numbers between 1 and 45.
*   **Interactive Elements:** A "Generate Numbers" button triggers the animation and displays the new lottery numbers.
*   **Styling:** The UI is styled with modern CSS, including custom properties for theming, and a subtle texture on the background.

## Current Plan

*   **Objective:** Create a visually engaging and interactive lottery number generator web page.
*   **Steps:**
    1.  **Update `index.html`:** Set up the basic structure with a title, a container for the app, and include the main JavaScript and CSS files.
    2.  **Update `style.css`:** Apply a modern and bold design to the page, including a color palette, typography, and layout for the lottery number generator.
    3.  **Update `main.js`:** Implement the lottery number generation logic within a custom Web Component (`<lotto-generator>`). This component will handle the state and presentation of the lottery numbers.
